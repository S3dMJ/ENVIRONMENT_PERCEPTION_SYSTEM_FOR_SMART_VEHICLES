# Prototype Operation Instructions

This README outlines the steps to operate the prototype developed on Jetson Nano with OpenCV and CUDA support. The prototype integrates multi-camera input and provides various functionalities like bird's eye view, object detection, and distance measurement.

## Setup and Operation

Follow these steps to set up and operate the prototype:

### 1. Turn On the Jetson Nano
- Ensure the Jetson Nano is powered on.
- Verify that OpenCV with CUDA support is installed and operational.

### 2. Camera and Arduino-Relays Circuit Setup
- Connect two out of the four cameras to the Jetson Nano.
- Attach the Arduino-relays circuit to the Jetson GPIO as shown in the attached video on the USB drive.

### 3. Running the Main Python Code
- Connect a keyboard to the Jetson Nano.
- Access the USB drive and locate the main Python script.
- Execute the script using the command: python3 [script_name].py.

### 4. Initial Camera Setup and Additional Cameras
- The program will initially display the feed from the two connected cameras.
- If the program runs successfully, connect the remaining two cameras.

### 5. Keypad Button Functions
- *Button 1*: Activate Bird's Eye View mode.
- *Button 2*: Display undistorted view from cameras 0 and 1.
- *Button 3*: Display undistorted view from cameras 2 and 3.
- *Button 4*: Turn on object detection for the front feed.
- *Button 5*: Turn on object detection for the back feed.
- *Button 6*: Display distance measurement for the front feed.
- *Button 7*: Display distance measurement for the back feed.
- *Button 0*: Exit the program.

## Notes
- The system utilizes OpenCV and CUDA for image processing and handling of camera feeds.
- Functions included are for rectifying stereo images, calculating distances, undistorting fisheye lenses, creating a bird's eye view, and object detection.
- GPIO pins on the Jetson Nano are used for keypad input.
- Ensure all hardware connections are secure and compatible.
- Monitor the console for any error messages for troubleshooting.
- make sure the cfg files provided in the usb are in the same directory as the script.
