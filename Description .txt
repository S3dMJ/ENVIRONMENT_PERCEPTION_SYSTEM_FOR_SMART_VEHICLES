Overview
The "Environment Perception System for Smart Vehicles" is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) designed to enhance driver awareness and safety. It addresses the critical issue of blind spots in vehicles, particularly during parking or lane changes, which pose significant accident risks. The system integrates state-of-the-art hardware and software to provide clear visuals, accurate object distances, and a comprehensive bird's-eye view in real-time.
